# Industrial Analytics Portfolio (Steel & Heavy Industry)

Portfolio focused on **industrial analytics / applied AI** and **OpEx audits + data roadmaps**, built from real-world steelmaking experience (data sanitized/simulated).

## Case Studies (public, sanitized)
1) **EAF Energy Reduction (-20%)** — DMAIC + loss driver analytics  
2) **Electrode Consumption Reduction (-30%)** — RCA + controlled trials  
3) **Availability Improvement** — constraint + flow analysis (ladle-waiting / power-off losses)

📁 See: `case-studies/`
